# ðŸ†• Enumerate Entra ID

If Entra ID is deployed in Active Directory with cloud sync active, the MSOL account is a high value target, due to its default configuration of having DCSync privileges. This MSOL account can be extracted from a local database on the sync server. To find the Entra ID sync server you can use the NetExec module \`entra-id\`:

```bash
nxc ldap $TARGET -u $USER -p $PASSWORD -M entra-id
```
