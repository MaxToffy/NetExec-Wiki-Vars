# ðŸ†• Dump VNC password from RealVNC or TightVNC

{% hint style="warning" %}
You need at least local admin privilege on the remote target, use option **--local-auth** if your user is a local account
{% endhint %}

RealVNC or TightVNC allow users to store credentials for connections. This module will automatically look for these credentials and extract them if found.

```bash
nxc smb $TARGET -u $USER -p $PASSWORD -M vnc
```
